In fall (autumn), New England is famous for its glorious foliage as billions 
of leaves change from green to a kaleidoscope 
of colors. The air is crisp and cool — perfect for hiking, biking or 
a classic fly-drive break along back roads, where farm stands are piled high 
with crunchy apples and orange pumpkins. When is the best time to come? 
The leaves start turning colors in the northern regions of Maine, Vermont, 
and New Hampshire typically around mid-to-late September and peaking around mid-October. 
In the more southern states of Massachusetts and Rhode Island 
and along the coast of New Hampshire and southern Maine, color starts later 
and often lasts up until November. 

Connecticut: Drive scenic State Route 169 parallel to the Rhode Island border, 
with picture-pretty villages such as Canterbury, Pomphrey, Brooklyn, and Woodstock. 
In Old Mystic, tour B. F. Clyde Cider Mill, America’s oldest steam-powered cider mill, 
family owned and run since 1881. Watch cider-making demonstrations 
on weekends in October and November. During fall harvest time, 
learn the difference between Merlot and Chardonnay, Cayuga and Seyval 
at the 25 wineries along the Connecticut Wine Trail.  Connecticut is one big orchard:
 in fall, pick your own pumpkins and apples Or, hike and bike in the  Last Green Valley,  
the 35-town National Heritage Corridor in the northeast corner of the state: 
five state parks, seven state forests, 80 ponds and lakes, and 130 miles of trails, 
including the East Coast Greenway.

Maine: In the midcoast, tour the Maine Maritime Museum, where you can 
see old boats, a shipyard and art, as well as take part in hands-on activities. 
Drive down a rocky promontory to Five Islands Lobster in Georgetown for a lobster roll:
 from Route 1, take 127 South. Local directions suggest: 
"keep going until your hat floats, and then just back up a bit." 
Enjoy fall color all over Maine: go hiking and biking in 
Acadia National Park canoe and listen to loons in the Rangeley Lakes region. 
And, for a spectacular view, take the elevator to the observatory 
high up on the Penobscot Narrows Bridge. 

Masssachusetts:  Drive along the Mohawk Trail in Western Massachusetts — America’s 
first officially designated "scenic road." 
It runs up and over the Berkshire Hills and leads to state parks 
and forests for hiking and biking. Drive to the top of Mount Greylock 
for fabulous foliage views. At Natural Bridge State Park, see a true wonder, 
North America’s only naturally formed white marble arch. 
Or, zipline through the tree canopy on one of the ziplines 
found throughout the state. North of Boston, 
go out to Cape Ann and take a boat tour from Gloucester or Essex.

New Hampshire:In the beautiful White Mountains region, 
you can stand on the top of New England: the summit of Mount Washington. 
Get there on the Auto Road (self-drive or van tours) 
or on the historic Cog Railway. Want to climb an easy mountain? 
Near Jaffrey, Mount Monadnock is the "most climbed mountain in North America," 
with great views from the top. In the Lakes Region, 
take a cruise on the M/S Mount Washington. 
With mountains as a backdrop, the foliage seems to wrap around Lake Winnipesaukee. 
Up in northern New Hampshire, 
Dixville Notch is an area covered with endless unspoiled scenery, 
exceptional hiking, mountain biking.

Rhode Island: The USA’s smallest state is making a name 
for itself as a producer of wine. 
And, when better to visit the vineyards than at harvest time? 
With lunch and a tasting, this is a great day out. 
But, across the state, Rhode Island farms are also celebrating their bounty; 
stop at farm stands, pick-your-own and join-in-the-harvest festivals. 
Or, go back in time to the start of America’s industrial revolution. 
At Slater Mill, Samuel Slater built North America’s first successful water-powered, 
cotton-spinning mill on the banks of the Blackstone River. 
Tour this historic area by boat and see the fall color on the Blackstone Valley Explorer.
Vermont:For birds-eye views of the foliage, head for Bennington. 
At the Battle Monument, you can scan the landscape from the top, more than 300 ft. 
(91m) above the ground. And, you don’t have to climb any stairs; just take the elevator! 
Or, drive up the very steep Skyline Drive to the top of Mount Equinox, south of Manchester. 
On a clear day, you can see across New England, into New York State and even into Canada. 
Burlington makes a great base for seeing the foliage: 
take a Lake Champlain cruise, or go up in a hot-air balloon!
